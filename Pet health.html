<h1>Pet Health: The Basis</h1>
<p>Keeping your pet healthy is all about regular care, good nutrition, and lots of love. Just like humans, pets need balanced diets, exercise, routine checkups, and mental stimulation to stay in top shape. Regular vet visits help catch health issues early, while vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and dental care protect your pet from common diseases.</p>

<p>A happy, healthy pet is active, alert, has a shiny coat, clear eyes, and a good appetite. Watch for signs like unusual behavior, changes in eating habits, or low energy—these could mean it's time for a vet visit.</p>

<p>Remember, a little daily care goes a long way in giving your pet a long, joyful life!</p>
