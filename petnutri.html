<h1>Pet Nutrition</h1>
<p>Pet nutrition is essential for maintaining your pet's overall health, energy, and well-being. Just like humans, pets need a balanced diet that provides the right mix of nutrients — including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals — to stay healthy.</p>
</center>
<h3>Here are some tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feed a Balanced Diet</li>
<p>Make sure your pet's food includes all the essential nutrients-proteins, fats, carbs, vitamins and minerals. Look for food labeled as "complete and balanced" for their life stage.</p>
<li>Watch the Portion Sizes</li>
<p>Overfeeding is one of the most common causes of pet obesity. Stick to the feeding guidelines on the package, and adjust based on your pet's activity level and weight.</p>
<li>Keep Water Fresh and Full</li>
<p>Just like us, pets need access to clean, fresh water at all times. Hydration helps with digestion, temperature, regulation and overall health.</p>
<li>Go Easy On Treats</li>
<p>Treats should make up no more than 10% of your pet's daily calories. And steer clear of giving pets human food like chocolate, grapes, onions etc can be toxic.</p>
<li>Feed According to Life Stage</li>
<p>Puppies and kittens need food with extra calories and nutrients,while senior pets may need lower-calorie or specialized diets.</p>
<li>Stick to a Routine</li>
<p>Feeding your pet at the same times each day helps with digestion and makes it easier to spot changes in appetite-which can be an early sign of illness.</p>
<li>Use Slow Feeders</li>
<p>These help prevent gulping, aid digestion and provide mental stimulation-great for fast eaters</p>
</ul>
